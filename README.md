## Issues
This webpage was much easier to style with Bootstrap than assignment 2. I didn't have too many issues, but one I did struggle with was adding the background color to the second "Dine-In or Take-Out" section. It took some messing around, but I finally was able to organize my containers in a way that allowed me to achieve the full width background color. 

## Resources 
I used the Bootstrap documentation as a resource throughout the coding of this page. I also largely utilized the course videos from this module to utilize LESS.
